phono-differ
This is a tool for students of phonetics and phonology. To use it, select sounds from the chart, and their phonetic "distinctive features" will be compared. Shared [+features] and [-features] will be shown in the web browser.

The tool uses features from the Hayes (2009) chart provided to our Fall 2021 LING 4040 class @ UNT, with the following exceptionsː

[f] and [v] are [+strident].
[ʟ] is [+lateral].
I copied the features from the chart by hand, so there are probably tons of mistakes. If you see any, please let me know!
I would like to add to this project and make it as cool and useful as possible. If you have any suggestions or catch any errors, please contact me, Joseph McCreary, at ReaganMcCreary@my.unt.edu. If you're feeling spicy, create an issue on GitHub, or submit a pull request.
