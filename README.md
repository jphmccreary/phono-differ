# phono-differ

This is a tool for students of phonetics and phonology. To use it, select sounds from the charts on the page, and their distinctive features will be compared. Shared [+features] and [-features] will be shown in the web browser. When only two sounds are selected, you can see exactly which features change between them.

The tool uses features from the Hayes (2009) chart provided to our Fall 2021 LING 4040 class @ UNT, with the following exceptionsː
- [f] and [v] are [+strident].
- [ʟ] is [+lateral].
- The labiodental flap [ⱱ] was missing and has been added.
- The velar approximant [ɰ] was missing and has been added.
- Some of the "fronted velars" and "backed velars" from the chart are not included, for now.
- If something was missing from the Hayes chart, I made my best guess at its features.
- **I copied the features from the chart by hand, so there's probably a ton of mistakes. If you see any, please let me know!**

I would like to add to this project and make it as cool and useful as possible. If you have any suggestions or catch any errors, please contact me, Joseph McCreary, at ReaganMcCreary@my.unt.edu. If you're feeling spicy, create an issue on GitHub, or submit a pull request.
